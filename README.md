# Tic Tac Toe
A command line based tic tac toe game set up for 2 human players to play against one another.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: Ruby

This entire application was built using Ruby, and is meant to be played in the command line. The game will retrieve necessary information from players (such as their player number, chosen symbol, location choice) etc, and show the updated board between each player's turn. Winner is called when a player gets 3 of their symbola across. Or game ends when all positions are filled with no winner. The board is displayed as an array of array elements stacked on top of one another. 

# Optimizations

If I had more time to focus on the project, one thing I would do would be to refractor and condense the code. I think there's an opportunity to write more precise and less repeated code, especially when calculating winner conditions. Additionally, I would add functionality that allows a human to play against a computer, rather than another human. This would likely be done by having the computer select random positions to place their symbol.

# Lessons Learned:
This project was great practice for OOP. It was the first project I've done in scratch from Ruby specifically utilizing OOP concepts, and I learned a lot from it.
